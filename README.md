todo.
1. Go in XYZRGBA and fix poly fan and then add draw line
2. add highlight to selected cell and debug selected cell / flipy or not flipy
3. why now that i added centroids edge ones look fucked / have negative centroids?
4. add to git and removal of voronoice library stuff
5. minrng / noise library. goodhash(&mut u32) cheaphash(&mut u32). chec dat vid for the ones it had. test performance, test randomness with image buffer output. and yea gradient noise it.
6. matrix lib
7. reusing / freeing vbo vao

w. resizing etc will wayland allow? new winit demo maybe?
w+1. non uniform voronoi grids eg random repulsion force value
w+2. look better: antialias + noise / why didnt i just use worley xd but the neighbour info
w+3. rivers were cool etc
w+4. productivity area calculation
w+5. auto take ref for vector? auto borrow? ok so there is for self method. what about implementing operator overloads for ref Vec2 with Vec2 etc.
w+6. not quite voronoi - random deletion of cells too, maybe after relax
w+7. make 3d. i mean hey a cool looking map generation for a game. texture could be cool
w+8. take to web
