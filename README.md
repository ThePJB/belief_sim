misc voronoi shit - spring system - differently sized gaps
or its funny relaxation then randomly delete


Questions here about pgm / mesh / shader / vertex buffer abstraction
and also of engine abstraction
and of noise/rng packages

TODO: fix wayland glViewport shit

I could totally do this in 3d
clipping skirts by taking min

render3d

put a water clipping plane

is there some kind of cool nice mesh generation

is it something wrong with voronoi library: do I have to do it myself after all? i think it was yea delauney and circumcircle shit


Todo test triangle, test matrix
01 matrix remap to ndc
then its like is it the fookin voronoi thats wrong? need to do my custom voronoi shit?? theres improvements too

handling aspect: we could defs generate with a certain aspect then do aspect in proj mat
would like to fix window resizing but idk if its wayland thing
maybe updating to latest version of winit etc?

but anyway whats with the missing triangle shit, i should be using my own delauney
