ok what this says to me is it time for core logic

exponential population growth
needs to be some carrying capacity shit tho

and chance to invade threshold
and whether its peaceful or not peaceful
emigrating -or-
invading

itll be needing some mouse over to see culture values, play, pause, current year, etc.

## todo

        // maybe culture gets a attacking advantage threshold before attack
        // fight to the death vs flee in culture, one might be fitter
        // what about reduce chance to attack friendly or friendly threshold for not attack
        // terrain defensibility
        // self / not self barrier and shit
// todo favour larger more


5. minrng / noise library. goodhash(&mut u32) cheaphash(&mut u32). chec dat vid for the ones it had. test performance, test randomness with image buffer output. and yea gradient noise it.
6. matrix lib
7. reusing / freeing vbo vao

w. resizing etc will wayland allow? new winit demo maybe?
w+1. non uniform voronoi grids eg random repulsion force value, not quite voronoi - random deletion of cells too, maybe after relax
w+2. look better: antialias + noise / why didnt i just use worley xd but the neighbour info
w+3. rivers were cool etc
w+4. productivity area calculation
w+5. auto take ref for vector? auto borrow? ok so there is for self method. what about implementing operator overloads for ref Vec2 with Vec2 etc.
w+6. make 3d. i mean hey a cool looking map generation for a game. texture could be cool
w+7. take to web

## ideas




data : average value and range for each parameter !!!
rollover popup shit
playback speed play pause etc
fuk im gonna need font rendering shit brah. worth making it nice too

less randomness needed on battle

carrying capacity proportional to area and shit please

um is everyone just invading cell 0?

yea needs side panel displaying cultural values, play pause etc, 

population log log straight up
oh yeah fucking the randomness cunt thats the next thing

// noone gets reduced to nothing
// also what about revolution, or inflation or something
